# Business Context
An employer or even another employee would benefit from  beign able to view non-sensitive infromation about other employees. 

## Installation
The user may create their repo and then download the npx create-react-app on the terminal in the correct directory. This will create a basic react app that the user may develop into an employee directory or any other app.

# Usage
The application is pulling information from the Random User API https://randomuser.me/ . The user is able to sort the employee infromation by name. The user is also able to filter the employee by any other property. 

## Credits
The application was developed from the basic React app that is provided. I also received assitance from the tutor and Bootcamp staff. 

## Tests
The user is able to test the applciation by having the localhost running. The localhost may run in development mode by "npm start" in the terminal. React provides development tools that may be used while working on the development of the app. The terminal also lets the user know if there is something that has not been defined or if it does not understand the code.
